# Discourse Functional Transcription (DFT)

_Discourse Functional Transcription_ (DFT) is a system for transcribing natural language discourse developed by [John W. DuBois][1] (Department of Linguistics, University of California, Santa Barbara). It consists of two components:

* a data format for representing transcripts in human- and computer-readable form

* a set of transcription conventions for representing various aspects of speech and its context

This repository contains specifications for formatting data in DFT, and the set of transcription conventions it uses.

## Versioning

DFT is the successor to two earlier versions of this system—DT1 and DT2 (where DT = Discourse Transcription).

This repository contains specifications for formatting data in the DT1, DT2, and DFT systems, and the set of transcription conventions used by each. It uses a form of [semantic versioning][2] to track changes to the DFT specification, where DT1 is considered v1.0, DT2 is v2.0, and DFT is v3.0. Each new version release may be viewed on the [releases page][3].

System | Version
------ | -----------
DT1    | v1.0
DT2    | v2.0
DFT    | v3.0+
